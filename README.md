# MICADO
MICADO infrastructures for COLA project The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications. COLA will demonstrate the applicability and impact of the solution via large scale near operational level SME and public sector pilots and demonstrators, and will also define a clear pathway how the innovation can be delivered to the market.

This ifrastructure descriptors are used by Occopus a cloud orchestrator tool. The main point is to create an autoscaling tool, that always kepp you cloud resources on the optimum level. You can find diferent well know open source tool involved such as, Prometheus, Consul, Haproxy too to create this reliable framework.
